**Explore Marine Life!**

Have you ever wondered what exactly is roaming around at your favorite beach, surfing or diving spot?

Big Pond can help you satisfy your curiosity!
If you are like me and didn't grow up around the ocean, hopefully Big Pond can also help you get over your fear of the unknown.

Have you ever googled "dangerous marine animal at location X"? You might be totally discouraged by all of the deadly sharks and venomous jellyfish horror stories that will come up.

Big Pond tries to solve this problem.
Each Animal is put in to one of three categories:
Green, Yellow or Red.
Green animals are safe and harmless.
By default the "scary" yellow animals are hidden to you to not discourage you from having fun in the water. But don't worry, as long as you follow the simple "don't touch" rule, you will be safe to enjoy the ocean.
If there are animals of the actually dangerous red category at your searched location the App will warn you.

**Happy Exploring!**
